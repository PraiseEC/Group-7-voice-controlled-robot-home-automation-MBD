MATLAB/Simulink Model-Based Design of a voice-controlled robot for home automation (Semester 2 continuation) 

# Voice-Controlled Robot (Model-Based Design)

This project simulates a voice-controlled robot using MATLAB Simulink and Stateflow. It continues from a previous semester hardware prototype and introduces model-based design principles, mechanical layout planning, and code-level implementation.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Simulated voice command inputs (`u = 0, 1, 2`)
- State-based control using Stateflow
- Output visualization with Scope
- Mechanical layout (TinkerCAD)
- Arduino-compatible logic in `.ino` format

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- MATLAB R2021a
- Simulink + Stateflow
- TinkerCAD (Mechanical layout)
- Arduino (code simulation)
